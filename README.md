# Oramac-v.LT
next version of v.LS


Same installation method as the previous version. 

Keybinds:
Toggle sprint = "Q"
Fullbright = "Z"
Tab gui is not functional but ots keybind is "/"
Killaura (im dumb and dunno how to code bypasses yet and it will probably instaban on hypixel) = "="
Inventory escape (work in progress) = "M"
FastPlace = "B"
NoFall (probably also instabans on hypixel idfk) = "H"
XRay (doesnt work rn im too fucking lazy use a texture pack) = "X"

A hack client base with toggle sprint and fullbright and fastplace and killaura and nofall.

best used with this texture pack "https://minecraft-resourcepacks.com/download/war-v2-pvp/" or "https://www.mediafire.com/file/cqrly6ccby98cbd/%C2%A78%21+%C2%A73Scope+%C2%A7832x+%C2%A77Revamp.zip" (not made by me) because otherwise the text looks like shit.

how to install it of u cant read "https://youtu.be/bXm605_0fag" otherwise --->
To use the client unzip this folder and drag the folder that says Oramac v.LT (not the one that says "Oramac-v.LT-main") then type "%appdata% into the windows search bar and got to ".minecraft" and then drag and drop that file into the versions folder.

Current issues:

tab gui is functional
killaura instabans on hypixel
nofall instabans on hypixel
inventory escape doesnt work
xray doesnt work

reason for all the issues: Im super fucking lazy and cant be bothered like i literally just code this when ive got nothing better to do so dont expect any bypasses until v.ZL1 (for context thats 5 versions away and its taken me ages just to put out these two)
